# Computer Vision Project
This is the repository for the Computer Vision Project at Innopolis University.\
I and Jerome, O. B. are teaming up to create a nice and cool application of computer vision and ML techniques.

## Installation
You must install pytorch some systems might require installing from source, disabling `USE_NNPACK=0`.
You might find the instructions [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source) and 
[here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/bug-w-nnpack-cpp-80-could-not-initialize-nnpack-reason-unsupported-hardware/107518/3)
very useful. Along the line you might have to 
`sudo apt install cmake`

We implemented this code in Ubuntu and thus had to use `espeak`.

See `requirements.txt` for a list of required packages.
